# Workflow Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach
Visual testing through n8n interface + automated validation.

## Core Workflow Tests

### Orchestrator Workflow
- [ ] Request routing to correct specialized workflows
- [ ] Response aggregation from multiple workflows
- [ ] Error handling for failed workflows
- [ ] Evolution trigger detection

### Telegram Bot Workflow  
- [ ] Message parsing and formatting
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Rich message formatting
- [ ] File upload handling

### Evolution Workflows
- [ ] Gap detection accuracy
- [ ] Architecture planning logic
- [ ] Workflow generation correctness
- [ ] Registry update consistency

## Testing Process
1. **Manual Testing**: Use n8n test execution
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end user scenarios  
3. **Evolution Testing**: Automated workflow creation
4. **Performance Testing**: Response time monitoring

## Test Data
- Sample user requests
- Mock external API responses
- Test workflow templates
- Error scenarios
